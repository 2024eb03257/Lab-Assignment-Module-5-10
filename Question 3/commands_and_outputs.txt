COMMANDS EXECUTED AND OUTPUTS

1) Make script executable
Command:
chmod +x validate_results.sh

(No output on success)

2) Show sample input file
Command:
cat marks.txt

marks.txt content:
101, Alice Smith, 45, 67, 78
102, Bob Jones, 32, 40, 50
103, Carol Lee, 90, 88, 92
104, Dan Brown, 33, 33, 32
105, Eve White, 31, 34, 35
106, Frank Black, 60, 29, 70

3) Run the validator
Command:
./validate_results.sh marks.txt

Output:
Students who failed in exactly ONE subject:
102, Bob Jones
104, Dan Brown
105, Eve White
106, Frank Black

Students who passed ALL subjects:
101, Alice Smith
103, Carol Lee

Counts:
Passed all: 2
Failed exactly one: 4

Explanation:
- Passing mark per subject = 33
- Script reads CSV-style lines, trims whitespace, treats non-numeric marks as 0
- It counts failures per student and classifies:
  * failed exactly one subject -> listed under first group
  * passed all subjects -> listed under second group
- Final counts summarize group sizes

Exit codes:
- 0 on success (script completed and printed results)
- 1 if input file missing or unreadable

Saved files:
None; outputs printed to stdout. You can redirect to a file if needed:
./validate_results.sh marks.txt > results.txt
