1. ARGUMENT VALIDATION COMMAND
   Command: [ $# -ne 1 ]
   Explanation:
   - $#: Returns the total number of command-line arguments passed to the script
   - -ne: "not equal" operator
   - This checks if the argument count is NOT equal to 1
   - Used with 'if' statement to validate exactly one argument is provided

2. PATH EXISTENCE CHECK COMMAND
   Command: [ ! -e "$1" ]
   Explanation:
   - !: Logical NOT operator (negates the condition)
   - -e: File test operator meaning "file exists"
   - "$1": First command-line argument (the path provided by user)
   - This checks if the path does NOT exist
   - Used to validate the provided path is valid

3. FILE CHECK COMMAND
   Command: [ -f "$1" ]
   Explanation:
   - -f: File test operator meaning "is a regular file"
   - "$1": The path provided by user
   - Returns true if the path is a file (not directory)
   - Used to determine if analysis should be for a file

4. WORD COUNT COMMAND - LINES
   Command: wc -l < "$1"
   Explanation:
   - wc: Word Count utility (counts lines, words, characters)
   - -l: Flag to count lines only
   - <: Input redirection operator (reads file contents)
   - "$1": The file path
   - Output: Number of lines in the file
   - Example: wc -l < myfile.txt returns 42 (if file has 42 lines)

5. WORD COUNT COMMAND - WORDS
   Command: wc -w < "$1"
   Explanation:
   - wc: Word Count utility
   - -w: Flag to count words only
   - <: Input redirection operator
   - "$1": The file path
   - Output: Number of words in the file
   - Example: wc -w < myfile.txt returns 100 (if file has 100 words)

6. WORD COUNT COMMAND - CHARACTERS
   Command: wc -c < "$1"
   Explanation:
   - wc: Word Count utility
   - -c: Flag to count characters/bytes only
   - <: Input redirection operator
   - "$1": The file path
   - Output: Number of characters (bytes) in the file
   - Example: wc -c < myfile.txt returns 512

7. STRING TRIM COMMAND
   Command: tr -d ' '
   Explanation:
   - tr: Translate/transform characters
   - -d: Delete mode (removes specified character)
   - ' ': Space character to remove
   - Used in pipeline to remove whitespace from wc output
   - Example: "   42  " | tr -d ' ' produces "42"

8. DIRECTORY CHECK COMMAND
   Command: [ -d "$1" ]
   Explanation:
   - -d: File test operator meaning "is a directory"
   - "$1": The path provided by user
   - Returns true if the path is a directory
   - Used to determine if analysis should be for a directory

9. FIND COMMAND - COUNT TOTAL FILES
   Command: find "$1" -maxdepth 1 -type f
   Explanation:
   - find: Searches for files/directories matching criteria
   - "$1": Search directory path
   - -maxdepth 1: Limit search to 1 level deep (only direct children, not subdirectories)
   - -type f: Find only regular files (not directories)
   - Output: List of all files in the directory
   - Piped to wc -l to count them

10. FIND COMMAND - COUNT TEXT FILES
    Command: find "$1" -maxdepth 1 -name "*.txt" -type f
    Explanation:
    - find: Searches for files/directories matching criteria
    - "$1": Search directory path
    - -maxdepth 1: Limit search to 1 level deep
    - -name "*.txt": Match files with .txt extension
    - -type f: Find only regular files
    - Output: List of .txt files in the directory
    - Piped to wc -l to count them

11. VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT WITH COMMAND SUBSTITUTION
    Command: lines=$(wc -l < "$1" | tr -d ' ')
    Explanation:
    - $(...): Command substitution - executes command and captures output
    - Assigns the result to a variable
    - Example: lines=$(wc -l < myfile.txt | tr -d ' ') stores "42" in variable 'lines'

12. EXIT COMMAND
    Command: exit 1
    Explanation:
    - exit: Terminates the script
    - 1: Exit status code (0 = success, non-zero = error)
    - Used to exit script when error conditions are met
    - Example: exit 1 indicates script failed
